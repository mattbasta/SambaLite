# Changelog

All notable changes to SambaLite will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.5.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Guest login fails (issue #32)**: Connections without username and password previously used `AuthenticationContext.guest()`, which sends the username `Guest`. Samba servers with a guest-accessible share but without `map to guest = Bad User` (the Samba default is `map to guest = Never`) reject this login with `NT_STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER` / `NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. SambaLite now performs a true anonymous login (empty username and password), matching the behavior of `mount.cifs -o guest`.
- **SMB3 crash on anonymous sessions**: Anonymous/guest connections are now restricted to SMB2 dialects (SMB 2.1 / 2.0.2). SMBJ 0.14.0 crashes with a `NullPointerException` when deriving SMB3 signing keys for anonymous sessions if the server does not set the IS_NULL/IS_GUEST session flags (hierynomus/smbj#792); SMB3 signing/encryption offers no protection for anonymous sessions anyway.

### Added
- **Tests**: New `GuestLoginIntegrationTest` reproducing the reporter's setup (Samba 4.23.x, guest-accessible share, no `map to guest` mapping) against a real Samba container, verifying that anonymous login succeeds where the old `guest()` login fails, and that the documented `map to guest = Bad User` workaround still works.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Default folder per connection**: Connections can now define an optional default folder inside the share (e.g. `Photos/2024`) that is opened automatically when connecting. The add/edit connection dialog validates the path (rejecting `\ : * ? " < > |`) and verifies on save that the folder actually exists on the server; if the existence check itself fails (e.g. server unreachable), the connection is still saved. The file browser navigates to the default folder only on a normal fresh start — not when opened from a notification or a Share handoff — and falls back to the share root with a hint if the folder no longer exists.
- **Timestamp preservation on downloads**: Downloaded files now keep the remote file's last-modified timestamp where possible. The new `MediaStorePathResolver` resolves `content://` URIs (MediaStore, external storage documents, `file://`) to real filesystem paths on which `File.setLastModified()` works, complementing the existing `utimensat()`-based SAF strategy in `TimestampUtils`. Authorities where both strategies fail are remembered per session to avoid repeated syscalls and warning spam during large syncs.
- Translations for the new default folder strings in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- **Faster SMB transfers**: SMB read/write/transact buffers are now requested at 8 MB (capped by server negotiation), copy buffers were increased from 64 KB to 256 KB (transfers) and 1 MB (`TransferWorker`), and large files (≥ 16 MB) are downloaded with multiple concurrently outstanding, pipelined SMB READ requests (6 readers, 4 MB chunks) with a dedicated writer thread. Progress updates during folder uploads are throttled using the same scheme as regular transfers. New `SmbRepository` methods `folderExists(...)` and `readFileBytes(...)` support the default folder check and single-handle thumbnail downloads.
- **Thumbnail loading rework**: Thumbnails are now downloaded once via a single SMB file handle (`readFileBytes`) and decoded from memory instead of streaming through the removed `SmbInputStream`. The disk cache is compressed (JPEG quality 85), trimmed at most once per minute on a dedicated executor, negative "no cover" markers expire after 7 days, and dropped queue tasks clear their pending marker so thumbnails can be requested again. View references are checked in a short-lived stack frame to avoid leaking Activity contexts from background threads.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate "B (1)" folders during sync**: Two sync workers could run concurrently for the same configuration (manual per-config sync vs. periodic/"sync all" worker) because WorkManager's unique work names differ. Sync runs are now serialized per configuration via process-wide locks. Additionally, directory creation guards against SAF providers silently deduplicating names: if a duplicate like `B (1)` is created, it is removed and the existing directory is reused.
- **Sync misses files with accented or differently-cased names**: Local file lookups during sync now normalize names to Unicode NFC (SMB servers often deliver NFD) and fall back to a case-insensitive match (SMB is case-insensitive, HashMap lookups are not), preventing unnecessary re-downloads and duplicate entries.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **Faster folder sync on high-latency connections (issue #21)**: When syncing local files to a remote share, SambaLite now fetches all remote file metadata for a directory in a single `share.list()` call instead of opening every remote file multiple times (existence check + timestamp read + size read). This mirrors the approach already used for remote-to-local sync and dramatically reduces the number of SMB round-trips, which dominate sync time over Wi-Fi or slow networks. Idle syncs (many files, few or no changes) that previously took minutes or hours now complete in seconds. The per-uploaded-file overhead is also reduced by avoiding redundant post-upload metadata reads.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Battery Optimization Reminder Controls**: The battery optimization reminder now offers a dedicated "Do not show again" action and snoozes the prompt for 14 days when users choose "Later". These choices are persisted so the reminder no longer appears on every launch when the app is still subject to Android battery optimization.
- **Modern Battery Optimization Dialog**: Added a Material Design 3 custom dialog layout with a battery icon, subtitle, explanatory card, and full-width action buttons for better readability and touch handling.
- Translations for the updated battery optimization reminder in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- **Battery Optimization Messaging**: The reminder text now explicitly covers background uploads, downloads, and scheduled syncs, while clarifying that users who mostly run manual sync can postpone or hide the reminder.

### Fixed
- **Invalid SMB share names**: The add/edit connection dialogs now reject share names containing path separators or characters that are invalid for SMB shares (`/ \ : * ? " < > |`). Existing saved connections with invalid share names are blocked from opening and guide users to edit the connection instead of failing later in the file browser.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Mirror Sync Mode**: One-way folder sync configurations (Local → Remote, Remote → Local) can now be run in mirror mode. After a successful sync, files and directories that previously existed on the source (tracked in the local sync state DB) but are no longer present in the source's current listing are removed on the target side as well. Mirror mode is implemented by the new `MirrorSweeper` class and is ignored for bidirectional sync.
- **Mirror Trash Safeguard**: When mirror mode is enabled, removed entries are by default moved into a hidden, per-run trash folder (`.sambalite-trash/<timestamp>/<relPath>`) at the target root instead of being permanently deleted. If the storage provider does not support move, the entry is deleted as a fallback. The behavior can be toggled via the new "Move to trash folder" option.
- **Mirror Sweep Sanity Limits**: To prevent catastrophic data loss from misconfigured shares or temporarily empty source listings, mirror sweeps abort automatically when the source listing is empty, or when the planned number of deletions exceeds 50% of the previously tracked entries AND more than 100 entries.
- **Mirror Action Logging**: New action types in `SyncActionLog` (`MIRROR_DELETED` 🪞, `MIRROR_TRASHED` 🪞, `MIRROR_ABORTED` 🪞) and corresponding counters in the sync run summary.
- **UI for Mirror Mode**: The sync setup and edit dialogs (`dialog_sync_setup.xml`) now offer a "Mirror mode" switch, a nested "Move to trash folder" switch, and a clear warning text explaining the destructive nature of the option. The sync configuration list (`item_sync_config.xml`) shows a "Mirror" indicator for configurations with mirror mode enabled.
- **Trash Exclusion**: The sync engine now skips the `.sambalite-trash` folder during scans so that mirror trash from previous runs is never re-uploaded, re-downloaded, or counted against the sweep sanity limits.
- **Tests**: New `MirrorIntegrationTest` (end-to-end mirror behavior against a Samba container) and `TrashExclusionTest`. `SyncStateStore` now exposes a public DAO-injection constructor to make mirror logic testable without the Android runtime.
- Translations for all new mirror-mode strings in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- **`FolderSyncWorker` rework**: Significantly extended (~700 added lines) to integrate `MirrorSweeper`, track per-run state, log mirror actions, and exclude the trash folder from scans on both local and remote sides.
- **`SyncManager.addSyncConfig` signature**: Extended with `mirror` and `mirrorUseTrash` parameters. The legacy 6-argument overload is preserved and now defaults mirror to `false` and `mirrorUseTrash` to `true`. Mirror is automatically disabled when the direction is `BIDIRECTIONAL`.
- **`SyncRepository` persistence**: `SyncConfig` JSON serialization now persists `mirror` and `mirrorUseTrash` (default: mirror off, trash on).
- **Documentation**: `docs/sync_user_guide.md` updated with a dedicated section on mirror mode, the trash safeguard, and the sanity limits.

### Fixed
- **Docker API compatibility for integration tests**: Testcontainers-based SMB tests previously failed against Docker Engine 29+ / OrbStack, which reject the default Docker Java client API version (1.32). The Docker API version is now pinned to 1.44 via `app/src/test/resources/docker-java.properties`, restoring CI and local integration test runs.
- **Unnecessary File List Refresh on Unrelated Uploads**: `FileBrowserActivity` previously refreshed the currently displayed directory after every completed upload, even when the upload target was an entirely different folder (e.g. background sync or share uploads to another path). The refresh now only triggers when the upload's parent directory matches the directory currently shown in the browser. The new helper `isUploadInDirectory(...)` normalizes the broadcast `remotePath`, strips the share-name prefix, and compares it against the share-relative current path. The `TransferWorker` upload-success broadcast carries the `EXTRA_REMOTE_PATH` extra used for this comparison.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Share upload to share root and duplicated path segments (Issue #27)**: When sharing files to SambaLite via the Android "Share" menu, uploads could fail or land at the wrong target if the share root or a subfolder with the same name as the share was selected. The share receiver incorrectly interpreted the first path segment as the connection name, producing paths such as `share/share/...` (e.g. `AA/AA`). The connection is now unambiguously referenced via the persisted connection ID, and the stored path is treated as a share-relative internal path (empty for the share root).
- **Wrong target for subfolders with the same name as the share in `SmbRepositoryImpl`**: `getPathWithoutShare()` stripped the first path segment when it matched the active share name. For a subfolder with the same name as the share (e.g. share `music` containing a subfolder `music`), this caused `delete`, `rename`, and `create` operations to silently act on the share root instead of the subfolder. The method now only normalizes leading slashes and leaves the path otherwise unchanged.
- **Consistent persistence of the current folder in `FileBrowserActivity`**: When changing the remote folder, the internal path (without the share prefix) is now stored together with the connection ID, so subsequent share handoffs can reconstruct the correct upload target.

### Changed
- **Simplified share receiver flow**: Heuristics for deriving the connection from the target path (`getConnectionFromTargetPath`, `getConnectionNameFromTargetFolder`, `getPathFromTargetFolder`) have been removed. The confirmation dialog still shows a readable "share/sub/path" label, composed from the connection ID and the internal path.
- **Tests**: Extended and stabilized unit tests for `ShareReceiverActivity`, `FileBrowserActivity` (new path normalization and upload target helpers), and `PathProcessingTest`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Directory Multi-Select Operations**: Directories can now be selected in multi-select mode. Multi-select delete supports directories with a confirmation warning, and multi-select download supports recursive directory downloads.
- **WiFi-Only Folder Sync**: New `wifiOnly` option for folder sync configurations. When enabled, `FolderSyncWorker` checks the WiFi constraint before syncing, and `SyncManager` sets `NetworkType.UNMETERED`. A MaterialSwitch is available in the sync setup and edit dialogs, and the WiFi-Only status is displayed in the sync configuration overview.
- **SMB Port Support**: Custom SMB port can now be configured per connection in the connection model and repository.
- **Connection Cleanup**: New `closeConnections()` method in `SmbRepository` for explicit connection lifecycle management.
- **Testcontainers Integration**: Added Testcontainers support with a Samba container for realistic SMB integration testing in CI.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: New integration and unit tests for WiFi constraints, end-to-end sync workflows, transfer queue integration, error recovery, search functionality, and notification handling.
- Translations for directory selection and WiFi-Only strings in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- **Selection Subtitle**: Toolbar subtitle now shows the count of selected files and directories separately during multi-select mode.
- **Disk Space Check Refactoring**: Moved disk space check logic to `EnhancedFileUtils` for better separation of concerns.
- **Directory Download moved to TransferWorker**: Recursive directory download logic moved from `FileOperationsViewModel` into `TransferWorker`. A single `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY` placeholder is enqueued, and the worker resolves directory contents using its own SMB connection — avoiding dependency on the (possibly closed) UI-layer SMB session.
- **TransferWorker Work Policy**: Changed `ExistingWorkPolicy` from `REPLACE` to `KEEP` to prevent restarting an already running transfer worker when new transfers are enqueued.
- **Transfer Queue Scalability**: Transfer list query now uses `LIMIT 500` to prevent `CursorWindow` overflow on large queues. Status counts (Pending, Active, Completed, Failed, Total) are observed via separate lightweight `COUNT` queries for accurate stats display independent of the list limit.
- **Transfer Badge Performance**: `FileListController` now uses lightweight path-only DAO queries (`getActiveUploadPathsForConnection`, `getActiveDownloadPathsForConnection`) instead of loading full `PendingTransfer` objects for UI badge indicators.
- **TransferItemAdapter Cleanup**: Removed verbose `Log.v` debug logging from `DiffUtil` callbacks.
- **Test Infrastructure Overhaul**: Reworked `SmbTestHelper` and `SambaContainer`, updated and stabilized existing repository tests, and updated test documentation with the new test structure.

### Fixed
- **Disk Space Protection in TransferWorker**: Added comprehensive disk space checks before, during, and after transfers. The worker now stops immediately when disk space is insufficient instead of retrying endlessly, and returns `Result.failure()` when disk is full.
- **Disk Space Protection in FolderSyncWorker**: Added disk space checks before each sync config, before each file download, and periodically during downloads (every 10 MB). Sync aborts gracefully via `InsufficientDiskSpaceException` when disk space runs low.
- **SQLiteFullException Crash Prevention**: `SmartErrorHandler` now catches `SQLiteFullException` on WorkManager threads (caused by WorkManager internal DB operations when disk is full) and swallows them to prevent app crashes.
- **Robust DB Error Handling in TransferWorker**: Wrapped transfer status updates in try-catch to prevent secondary crashes when the database is full.
- **System Monitor Disk Info**: `SystemMonitorActivity` now displays internal and external storage usage with free/total space and a low disk space warning.
- **Sort Dialog Crash in Landscape Mode**: Fixed a `NullPointerException` crash when opening the sort dialog in landscape orientation. The landscape layout (`dialog_sort.xml`) was missing the `show_thumbnails_checkbox`, and `getDirectoriesFirst().getValue()` could return `null` causing an unboxing crash.
- **Upload Crash After ViewModel Cleared**: Fixed a `RejectedExecutionException` crash in `FileOperationsViewModel` when tasks were submitted to the background executor after the ViewModel had been cleared. All executor submissions now use a safe wrapper that catches rejected tasks gracefully.
- **Battery Dialog Crash**: Fixed a `BadTokenException` crash when showing the battery optimization dialog after the activity was already finishing or destroyed. Added lifecycle checks before displaying the dialog.
- **Unnecessary Refresh on Download**: Removed redundant file list refreshes after each completed download. Since downloads don't modify the remote directory, the per-file refresh was wasting resources — especially during batch downloads with many small files. Refreshes now only occur after uploads.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Thumbnail Support (NEW)**: Introduced a "Show thumbnails" option in the sort dialog. Thumbnails are managed by a new `ThumbnailManager` for efficient loading and display in the file list. To ensure best performance, this feature is disabled by default.
- **Improved Data Streaming**: Introduced `SmbInputStream` for more robust and efficient data reading from SMB shares.
- **Enhanced Share Discovery**: Significantly expanded list of common share names (now includes localized names for media, documents, and technical folders) and implemented parallel share discovery with 8 threads for faster results.
- **Dynamic Connection Feedback**: Share discovery in the "Add Connection" dialog now automatically triggers when updating username, password, or domain, providing immediate feedback.
- Translations for the new thumbnail option in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- **Folder Sync Optimization**: Improved performance and reliability of folder synchronization by implementing local file caching. This avoids expensive and potentially error-prone `findFile()` calls in the Storage Access Framework (SAF), which could previously cause duplicate file creations.
- **Performance Optimization**: `IntelligentCacheManager` now uses a pool of 4 threads (increased from 1) for concurrent operations.
- **Cache Reliability**: Added a mechanism to `IntelligentCacheManager` to prevent redundant disk writes for the same cache key in quick succession.
- **UI FAB Refactoring**: Reorganized the Floating Action Buttons (FAB) in the file browser for "Select All" and "Clear Selection" for better consistency.

### Fixed
- **Foreground Service Compliance**: `SmbBackgroundService` now calls `startForeground()` more reliably at every start to satisfy Android's strict 5-second contract for foreground services, preventing potential crashes.
- **File List Consistency**: Implemented an update ID mechanism in `FileAdapter` to prevent stale search or directory results from overwriting newer content during rapid navigation or searching.
- **Lifecycle Handling**: Improved lifecycle handling in `FileListViewModel` and `FileAdapter` to prevent potential memory leaks or inconsistent states during view updates.
- **UI Interaction**: Added missing "Cancel" buttons to sort and filter dialogs for better navigation control.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Fixed visibility and ordering of share discovery results in the connection dialog.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Sync Configuration Management on Main Screen**: Folder sync configurations are now displayed directly on the main screen with a dedicated list. Each configuration shows connection details, sync interval, and last sync time. A popup menu provides quick access to "Sync Now", "Edit", and "Remove" actions.
- **Live Sync Status**: The main screen observes WorkManager to display real-time sync running/idle status for each configuration, with automatic UI refresh when sync completes.
- **Sync Completion Feedback**: Snackbar notifications now inform the user whether a sync completed successfully, failed, or was interrupted and will be retried.
- **Multi-Select in Transfer Queue**: The Transfer Queue now supports multi-selection with "Select All", "Deselect All", and batch action FABs for managing multiple transfers at once.
- **Multi-Select in File Browser**: The File Browser gains a "Select All" FAB for quickly selecting all visible files during multi-selection mode.
- **Sync Configuration Editing**: Existing sync configurations can be updated in-place via the new edit option in the popup menu.
- **Persistent Transfer Queue Preferences**: Sort mode and "Hide completed" filter in the Transfer Queue are now persisted across sessions via SharedPreferences.
- New icons: `ic_menu_selectall`, `ic_menu_unselectall`, `ic_menu_more` for selection and overflow actions.
- Translations for all new strings in all 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH), including sync status messages (completed, failed, cancelled).

### Changed
- **Transfer Queue multi-select toggle**: Tapping a transfer item in multi-select mode now toggles its selection on and off, and multi-select mode exits automatically when the last item is deselected.
- **Shared text cache cleanup moved to TransferWorker**: Temporary files created by `ShareReceiverActivity` for text shares are now cleaned up after successful upload inside `TransferWorker`, instead of immediately at enqueue time in `FileOperationsController`. This ensures the source file remains available for retry if the upload fails.
- `SyncConfigAdapter` now resolves and displays human-readable local paths (from content URIs) and full server paths (e.g. `//server/share/path`) instead of raw URIs and relative remote paths.
- Sync action callbacks (`onSyncNowClick`, `onEditClick`, `onRemoveClick`) moved from `MainActivity` into `SyncConfigAdapter` for better separation of concerns.
- `SyncConfigAdapter` receives the list of `SmbConnection`s to build full server paths for display.
- Sync configuration item layout (`item_sync_config.xml`) redesigned to show local path and improved visual structure.
- `SyncConfig` model extended with transient `isRunning` flag for live UI status tracking.
- `SyncManager` now supports updating existing sync configurations via `updateSyncConfig()`.
- `PendingTransferDao` extended with additional query methods for batch operations.
- Transfer item layout updated with overflow "more options" button.
- Main activity layout updated to include sync configuration list section.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-02

_First public release after 1.8.3. Versions 2.0.0–2.0.6 were internal development builds and were not published to Play Store or F-Droid._

### Added
- **Persistent Transfer Queue**: Uploads and downloads are now queued persistently and processed in the background via WorkManager. Transfers survive app kills and device restarts, with automatic resume from the last byte offset. Includes foreground notification with live progress, connection reuse, direct SAF→SMB streaming, and disk space checks.
- **Transfer Queue Activity**: New dedicated screen to view, sort, retry, cancel, and remove queued transfers. Supports batch actions, status filtering, sorting by name/date/status, and a "Hide completed" filter.
- **Individual transfer cancellation**: Users can cancel individual transfers without stopping the entire queue.
- **Background transfer progress**: Accurate byte-level progress display in notifications for uploads and downloads.
- **Background Search**: File search now runs in the background via WorkManager with live results appearing as they are found. Survives activity recreation.
- **Batch file deletion**: Multiple files can be deleted in a single SMB session, improving performance and avoiding oplock issues.
- **Multi-file overwrite dialog**: When uploading files that already exist, users can individually select which files to overwrite.
- **Async transport option**: New per-connection toggle for faster SMB transfers using async direct TCP transport.
- **Transfer status badges**: Files with active uploads or downloads display a transfer badge in the file browser.
- **Blocked actions during transfer**: Files currently being transferred cannot be edited or multi-selected, preventing conflicts.
- **Authentication before security settings**: Biometric/device authentication is now required before opening security settings if any auth setting is enabled.
- **Connection failure tracking**: The transfer worker skips unreachable connections for the remainder of a run, avoiding tight retry loops.
- Translations for all new strings in all 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- Uploads and downloads no longer block the UI with progress dialogs — they are enqueued and processed in the background.
- File search rewritten from blocking in-process execution to WorkManager-backed background search with Room persistence.
- Batch file deletion replaces one-by-one deletion for multi-file operations, with single directory refresh after completion.
- Unified user feedback: All messages now use Snackbar exclusively (Toast removed). Consistent color semantics: green = success, red = error, blue = informational.
- File-exists dialogs refactored to custom in-layout button views for better consistency.
- Layout improvements for long file names in file list and transfer queue items.

### Fixed
- **Database migration crash**: Databases now use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration` to prevent crashes on schema changes.
- **Cancelled transfer status**: Cancelled transfers are no longer overwritten with FAILED status.
- **Single-file delete verification**: Deletion is verified and retried if the file still exists due to SMB oplock delays.
- **Transfer integrity check**: File size comparisons now use actual file sizes instead of potentially stale database values.
- **Keyboard not dismissed on dialog close**: Fixed on devices where the keyboard reappeared after dismissing the rename dialog.
- **Folder upload overwrite selection**: Folder uploads now respect individual per-file overwrite selections.
- **Thread-safe date formatting** and **locale-independent sorting** in the transfer queue.

### Removed
- `FileUploadTask` class — upload logic is now handled by `TransferWorker`.
- `AdvancedNetworkOptimizer` class — network optimization is handled by the system `ConnectivityManager`.
- Toast-based user feedback — replaced entirely by Snackbar.
- Blocking progress dialogs for uploads and downloads.

</details>



## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-28
### Improved
- Transfer performance: Increased I/O buffer size from 8 KB to 64 KB for uploads and downloads.
- Upload progress reporting: Throttled progress updates to reduce UI overhead during large file transfers.

### Fixed
- Keyboard remains visible after renaming: On some devices (e.g., Amazon Fire Tablet), the soft keyboard reappeared after dismissing the rename dialog due to a race condition with pending focus events. Fixed by clearing focus on the edit text and adding a delayed secondary `hideKeyboard()` call (100ms) in the dialog's `OnDismissListener`.
- FAB buttons stuck in multi-selection state: After starting a batch download or delete via the floating action buttons, the selection UI (FAB icons, selection count) was not cleared. Added `clearSelection()` calls to both FAB click handlers to match the existing toolbar menu behavior.
- SAF folder picker missing "Use this folder" option: When reopening the folder picker for downloads, the previously used folder was shown but the "Use this folder" button was absent. Fixed by storing the last used download folder URI and setting `EXTRA_INITIAL_URI` on the picker intent. The stored URI is converted from a tree URI to a document URI via `DocumentsContract.buildDocumentUriUsingTree()`, which is required for the SAF picker to recognize the folder and offer the selection button.
- Duplicate progress dialogs: Prevented duplicate progress dialog creation when multiple operations start in quick succession by introducing a `dialogShowPending` guard flag.
- Upload/download state race condition: Fixed a race condition where the uploading/downloading LiveData could reflect a stale count by reading the AtomicInteger inside the posted Runnable instead of capturing a local snapshot.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-28
### Added
- Timestamp preservation on download: Remote file timestamps are now preserved when downloading files, both for manual downloads and folder sync. New `TimestampUtils` utility class with `setLastModified()` for `java.io.File` and `trySetLastModified()` as SAF best-effort via `Files.setLastModifiedTime()` over `/proc/self/fd/`.
- Robust sync comparison logic: New `SyncComparator` class compares files using size + timestamp with configurable tolerance (default: 3 seconds), replacing strict timestamp comparison that caused unnecessary re-transfers.
- Sync metadata database: New Room database (`SyncDatabase`) with `FileSyncState` entity and `SyncStateStore` wrapper for tracking remote file metadata (size, timestamp, sync time). Enables reliable sync decisions independent of unreliable SAF filesystem timestamps.
- Storage capability detection: New `StorageCapabilityResolver` and `TimestampCapability` enum classify storage targets as `PRESERVE_SUPPORTED`, `BEST_EFFORT`, or `UNRELIABLE` based on URI scheme.
- Timestamp statistics in System Monitor: New section showing tracked files count, timestamp preservation success rate, and SAF file percentage.
- Sync action logging for timestamp operations: `SyncActionLog` and `TransferActionLog` extended with `TIMESTAMP_SET`, `TIMESTAMP_FAILED`, and `DELETED` actions with summary counting.
- Comprehensive `[TIMESTAMP]`-prefixed logging across all download and sync paths for diagnostics via Logcat filtering.
- DB cleanup: Sync state entries are automatically deleted when sync configurations are removed or when remote files no longer exist.

### Changed
- `FolderSyncWorker`: Both sync directions (`syncLocalToRemote`, `syncRemoteToLocal`) now use `SyncComparator` and `SyncStateStore` for comparison instead of direct timestamp comparison. DB state is checked first as a fast path before falling back to filesystem comparison.
- `FileOperations`: All three copy methods (`copySingleFileWithProgress`, `copyFileToUriAsync`, `copyFileToUri`) now attempt to preserve the source file's timestamp on the destination URI after copying.
- `SmbRepositoryImpl`: All download methods (`downloadFileWithRetry`, `downloadFileDirectly`, `downloadFileWithProgressCallback`) now read the remote timestamp and set it on the local file via `TimestampUtils.setLastModified()`.

### Fixed
- Timestamp lost during file copy: Downloaded files had the correct timestamp on the temp file but lost it when copied to the final destination URI. Now `trySetLastModified()` is called after every copy operation.
- Unnecessary re-uploads in bidirectional sync with SAF: When SAF couldn't preserve timestamps, the local file's timestamp differed from the remote, causing re-uploads on every sync. Fixed by using DB-stored metadata as the primary comparison source.
- Main thread database access crash: `SyncStateStore.deleteAllForRoot()` was called on the main thread when deleting sync configurations, causing `IllegalStateException`. Moved to background thread via `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`.

### Known Limitations
- Setting the file timestamp on the device is not reliably possible for SAF (Storage Access Framework) destinations. Android's SAF API does not provide a `setLastModified()` method, and the best-effort workaround via `Files.setLastModifiedTime()` over `/proc/self/fd/` is blocked by `AccessDeniedException` on most devices (confirmed on GrapheneOS and stock Android). This is a platform limitation, not a bug. The app compensates by storing remote timestamps in a local metadata database (`SyncStateStore`), ensuring correct sync behavior regardless of the local file's timestamp.

### Dependencies
- Updated `androidx.room` from 2.7.1 to 2.8.4 (`room-runtime`, `room-compiler`, `room-testing`).

### Developer Notes
- `TimestampUtils`: New utility class in `util/` with `setLastModified(File, long)` for direct file timestamps and `trySetLastModified(Context, Uri, long)` for SAF best-effort via `/proc/self/fd/`. Includes `SmartErrorHandler` integration for repeated failures.
- `SyncComparator`: New class in `sync/` with `isSame()`, `isRemoteNewer()`, `isLocalNewer()` methods using configurable timestamp tolerance.
- `SyncStateStore`: High-level wrapper around `FileSyncStateDao` with logging and exception handling. Uses `SyncDatabase` Room singleton.
- `FileSyncState`: Room entity with `UNIQUE(root_uri, relative_path)` constraint. Fields: `remote_size`, `remote_last_modified`, `synced_at`, `timestamp_preserved`.
- `StorageCapabilityResolver`: Classifies URIs by storage type (file → SUPPORTED, external storage → BEST_EFFORT, other SAF → UNRELIABLE).
- `SystemMonitorActivity.getTimestampStatus()`: Queries `SyncDatabase` for timestamp statistics displayed in the monitor.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-28
### Added
- "Manual only" sync interval option: Users can now disable periodic synchronization and trigger sync exclusively via "Sync now". New string resource `sync_interval_manual` added in all 7 supported languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Fixed
- SMB timestamp preservation on upload: Original file timestamps are now correctly transferred to the remote file after both single-file and folder uploads. Previously, uploaded files showed the upload time instead of the original modification date.
- `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` when setting remote file timestamps: Changed AccessMask from `GENERIC_WRITE` to `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES + FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES` in both `SmbRepositoryImpl` and `FolderSyncWorker`, resolving the `QueryInfo failed` error on NAS systems that don't grant `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` via `GENERIC_WRITE`.
- SMB client configuration in `FolderSyncWorker`: The sync worker now uses the connection's encryption, signing, and dialect settings (via new `createSmbClient()` method) instead of an unconfigured default `SMBClient`.
- Temporary file timestamp loss during upload: When copying a file from a content URI to a temp file for upload, the original `lastModified` timestamp from `DocumentFile` is now preserved on the temp file, ensuring the correct timestamp is passed to `setRemoteFileLastModified()`.
- Manual sync swipe-kill resilience: "Sync now" operations now use Expedited Work with a Foreground Service notification, preventing Android from killing the sync when the app is swiped away. Added `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` declaration for WorkManager's `SystemForegroundService` in `AndroidManifest.xml` to fix a `FATAL EXCEPTION` crash (`foregroundServiceType 0x00000001 is not a subset of 0x00000000`).

### Developer Notes
- `FolderSyncWorker.createSmbClient(SmbConnection)`: New method that mirrors `SmbRepositoryImpl.getClientFor()` to apply encryption, signing, and SMB dialect settings from the connection configuration.
- `SmbRepositoryImpl.setRemoteFileLastModified()`: New private method for setting remote file timestamps after upload, using `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES + FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES` AccessMask.
- `FileOperations.getLastModifiedFromUri()`: New private method to extract the original last-modified timestamp from content URIs via `DocumentFile` or `DocumentsContract`.
- `SyncManager.addSyncConfig()` now accepts interval 0 (manual); `schedulePeriodicSync()` cancels periodic sync when all configs are manual.
- `FolderSyncWorker`: Skips configs with `intervalMinutes ≤ 0` during periodic sync execution.
- `FolderSyncWorker.getForegroundInfo()`: New method providing a `ForegroundInfo` with notification channel `FOLDER_SYNC_OPERATIONS` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC`. Worker calls `setForegroundAsync()` at start of `doWork()` for both manual and periodic syncs.
- `SyncManager.triggerImmediateSync()`: Both overloads now use `setExpedited(OutOfQuotaPolicy.RUN_AS_NON_EXPEDITED_WORK_REQUEST)` for swipe-kill protection.
- `FolderSyncWorker.isStopped()` handling: Manual syncs return `Result.retry()` (job resumes after kill), periodic syncs return `Result.success()` (next scheduled run catches up).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added
- Biometric and device credential authentication: New `BiometricAuthHelper` enables optional biometric or PIN/pattern authentication before accessing shares and revealing saved passwords. Configurable via a new Security Settings dialog (`dialog_security_settings.xml`) accessible from the main menu.
- Transfer Action Log (`TransferActionLog`): Persistent log of file transfer actions (cache hits, cache misses, downloads, uploads) stored in SharedPreferences for diagnostics and debugging.
- Swipe-kill recovery: Active file operations are now persisted to SharedPreferences before process termination. On next launch, a Snackbar informs the user that a previous operation was cancelled.
- Stale cache temp file cleanup: `SmbBackgroundService` automatically removes orphaned `download*.tmp` files older than 1 hour from the cache directory on startup.
- Smart cache validation: Downloads now check for existing cache files with matching size and timestamp, skipping redundant re-downloads (cache hit/miss logging via `TransferActionLog`).
- Remote file existence check before upload: Uploads now verify whether the file already exists on the server before starting the transfer, allowing the user to confirm or cancel.
- `getRemoteFileSize()` method in `SmbRepository` for querying remote file sizes.
- Staging progress callback (`StagingProgressCallback`) for URI-to-file copy operations with byte-level progress reporting.
- New unit tests: `FileOperationsViewModelCacheTest`, `TransferActionLogTest`, `TimestampPreservationTest`, `SwipeKillBehaviorTest`.
- Translations for all new security, swipe-kill recovery, and progress strings in all supported languages (DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Changed
- Progress dialog is now deferred until the activity reaches RESUMED state, preventing crashes when the activity is not yet fully visible. Pending dialog requests are cancelled to avoid duplicates.
- Upload flow redesigned: Progress dialog is shown only after the remote existence check completes and the user confirms (or the file is new), providing clearer feedback.
- Byte-level progress formatting for both download and upload operations using `ProgressFormat`.
- "Finalizing" state added to `FileOperationsViewModel` to indicate post-transfer copy-to-destination phase in the UI.
- Gradle: `versionCode` bumped to 10800, `versionName` updated to 1.8.0.

### Fixed
- `ProgressFormat.Op.DOWNLOAD` label corrected.
- `BatteryOptimizationUtils` annotation fix.
- `DialogHelper` minor layout adjustment.
- Notification feature test updated for compatibility with new service behavior.

### Developer Notes
- `BiometricAuthHelper`: Wraps AndroidX Biometric API; checks availability via `BiometricManager` and triggers `BiometricPrompt` with `BIOMETRIC_WEAK | DEVICE_CREDENTIAL`.
- `TransferActionLog`: SharedPreferences-backed circular log (max 200 entries) with timestamped action records and JSON serialization.
- `PreferencesManager`: New preference keys for security settings (`auth_required_for_access`, `auth_required_for_password_reveal`).
- `SmbBackgroundService.onCreate()`: Added `cleanupStaleCacheTempFiles()` call for orphaned temp file removal.
- `ProgressController`: Lifecycle-aware dialog deferral via `LifecycleEventObserver` to avoid `IllegalStateException` on early dialog show.
- `FileOperationsController`: Refactored upload and download flows with pre-checks, staging progress, and cancel support.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Modernized all dialogs (Rename, Search, Sort, Progress, Sync Setup, Loading, Share) with Material Design 3 styling matching the Connection dialog: header with icon card, title and subtitle, MaterialCardView sections, and consistent 24dp padding.
- New custom layouts for Share dialogs (`dialog_share_upload.xml`, `dialog_share_needs_target.xml`, `dialog_upload_complete.xml`, `dialog_file_exists.xml`) with Material Design 3 header and card sections.
- New "Change folder" dialog (`dialog_change_folder.xml`) for Share workflow, displaying available connections as clickable Material cards (matching the Shares section in the Connection dialog).
- Night theme variant for `Theme.SambaLite.Dialog` to ensure correct text colors in Dark Mode.
- Translations for all new dialog subtitles and labels in all supported languages (DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).
- Automatic service shutdown: The background SMB service now stops automatically when all activities are closed and no file transfers are active, eliminating the need to manually stop the service.

### Changed
- Replaced CheckBox with MaterialSwitch in Search and Sort dialogs for a more modern appearance.
- Replaced ProgressBar with LinearProgressIndicator (Material Design 3) in the Progress dialog.

### Fixed
- Memory leak: `SmbBackgroundService$LocalBinder` (non-static inner class) held an implicit strong reference to the destroyed service, preventing garbage collection. Converted to a static class with `WeakReference`.

### Developer Notes
- `BackgroundSmbManager`: New `visibleActivityCount` (AtomicInteger) tracks visible activities. New `onActivityStarted()`/`onActivityStopped()` methods auto-stop the service when count reaches zero and no operations are active. Auto-stop check also added in `finishOperation()`.
- `MainActivity` and `FileBrowserActivity`: Added `onStart()`/`onStop()` lifecycle overrides to call the new activity tracking methods.
- `SmbBackgroundService.LocalBinder`: Converted from non-static inner class to `static` class with `WeakReference<SmbBackgroundService>`. Added `clearService()` called in `onDestroy()`.
- `BackgroundSmbManager.onServiceConnected()`: Updated to handle nullable return from `getService()`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Adaptive launcher icons for improved visual consistency across Android devices and launchers.
- `SharesDiffCallback` for efficient RecyclerView list updates when browsing SMB shares.
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated code quality checks (CI).
- New unit tests for caching, file utilities, diff callbacks, and progress formatting.
- Open files directly from SMB shares: New utility classes for file opening (`FileOpenHelper`), MIME type resolution (`MimeTypeUtils`), cache management (`OpenFileCacheManager`), and a custom `FileProvider` with `_data` column support for broad app compatibility.
- `downloadToCache` method in `FileOperationsViewModel` for managing open-file downloads and cache handling.
- Leave confirmation dialog when navigating away from the file browser during active file transfers.
- New unit tests for `MimeTypeUtils` and `OpenFileCacheManager` covering MIME type resolution, cache cleanup, and size-based eviction logic.
- Translations for leave confirmation and file open strings in all supported languages.
- FileProvider configuration (`file_paths.xml`) for external file sharing via content URIs.

### Changed
- Comprehensive `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` annotations added across the entire codebase (~40 classes) for improved null safety, API clarity, and `NullPointerException` prevention. Affected areas include ViewModels, controllers, adapters, repositories, utilities, cache classes, sync classes, Dagger components, and more.
- Enabled stricter lint checks with a new lint baseline for better code quality enforcement.
- Updated WorkManager dependencies to version 2.11.1.
- Removed unused resources, plurals, and obsolete strings; simplified layout attributes for dialogs.
- Refactored `SambaLiteApp` and utility classes for enhanced readability and formatting consistency.
- Removed redundant API-level checks in `BatteryOptimizationUtils`.
- Replaced `getMimeType` implementation in `FolderSyncWorker` with shared utility method from `MimeTypeUtils`.
- Prevented potential memory leaks in `DialogController` by replacing strong `Context` references with `WeakReference` and adding null checks.
- Made `instance` field volatile in `IntelligentCacheManager` to ensure thread-safe singleton access.
- Improved keyboard handling: New utility method for hiding keyboard in dialogs; dialogs now resize correctly with keyboard visibility.
- Added file transfer activity checks before finishing `FileBrowserActivity` and streamlined FAB visibility logic.
- Added default case handling in `SmartErrorHandler` switch statements for improved code clarity.
- Used UTF-8 charset explicitly in `hashString` method and simplified fallback hash calculation logic.
- Removed redundant code: unused `Locale` import and `getSubnetFromIp` method in `NetworkScanner`, unused `lastByteCount` field in `BandwidthMonitor`, redundant `if` checks in `DiscoveredServerAdapter` and `SharesAdapter`, unused `isLifecycleAtLeastStarted` method in `ProgressController`, redundant fallback cache key logic in `SearchViewModel`, unnecessary type checks in `SerializationValidator`.
- Suppressed lint warnings in `FileListCacheOperations`, `CacheMaintenanceManager`, `SmbBackgroundService`, `SmbRepositoryImpl`, `SearchCacheOperations`, and `ShareReceiverActivity` for future-use variables and non-API types.
- Open-file cache cleanup now runs on app start in `SambaLiteApp` initialization.
- Updated `AndroidManifest.xml`: Added FileProvider for external file sharing and handle configuration changes in `MainActivity`.

### Fixed
- `FileDiffCallback.areContentsTheSame` now compares timestamps correctly.
- Keyboard dismissal logic fixed in `MainActivity` dialogs.

### Developer Notes
- Lint baseline file added to track and gradually resolve pre-existing lint issues.
- `SharesDiffCallback`: New `DiffUtil.ItemCallback` implementation for `SmbFileItem` lists, enabling efficient partial RecyclerView updates.
- Null safety annotations applied systematically to: `FileBrowserUIState`, `FileListController`, `FileListViewModel`, `ConnectionAdapter`, `FileOperationCallbacks`, `FileSkippedException`, `FileUploadTask`, `InputController`, `LogUtils`, `PreferenceUtils`, `ProgressController`, `ProgressFormat`, `UIHelper`, `UserFeedbackProvider`, `ActivityResultController`, `DialogController`, `MemoryCacheStrategy`, `DiscoveredServerAdapter`, `SmbFileItem`, `LoadingIndicator`, `SearchCacheOperations`, `ShareReceiverViewModel`, `ShareReceiverActivity`, `SimplePerformanceMonitor`, `BatteryOptimizationUtils`, `SmartErrorHandler`, `CacheKeyGenerator`, `CacheExceptionHandler`, `SambaLiteApp`, Dagger components, `ViewModelFactory`, `ConnectionRepository`, `SmbRepository`, and related test classes.
- CI workflow: GitHub Actions pipeline for lint, unit tests, and build verification.
- `MimeTypeUtils`: Extracted shared MIME type resolution utility, used by both `FolderSyncWorker` and the new file open feature.
- `OpenFileCacheManager`: Size-based eviction cache for temporarily stored files opened from SMB shares.
- `DialogController`: Refactored to use `WeakReference<Context>` to prevent activity leak on configuration changes.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Sync Activity Log: All sync actions (uploads, downloads, skips, errors, directory creations) are now recorded with timestamps and displayed in the System Monitor. Shows the 25 most recent entries (newest first) with a summary of total actions.

### Changed
- Improved MIME type detection for folder sync: Replaced hardcoded MIME type mapping (only 7 file types) with Android's `MimeTypeMap`, supporting all file types known to the platform. This prevents file extension corruption when downloading files with uncommon extensions (e.g. `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.webp`, `.flac`) via the Storage Access Framework.

### Fixed
- System Monitor: Bottom content was partially obscured by the navigation bar. Added dynamic WindowInsets handling to ensure full scrollability.

### Developer Notes
- `FolderSyncWorker.getMimeType()`: Replaced manual if-chain with `MimeTypeMap.getSingleton().getMimeTypeFromExtension()`. Unknown extensions still fall back to `application/octet-stream`.
- New test class `FolderSyncWorkerGetMimeTypeTest` with 22 unit tests covering null, no extension, known types, uppercase, multiple dots, and unknown extensions (`.tqd`).
- Updated `docs/sync_user_guide.md` with new "Supported File Types" section and limitation note for uncommon file extensions.
- New class `SyncActionLog`: Persistent sync action log using SharedPreferences (FIFO, max 100 entries). Supports UPLOADED, DOWNLOADED, SKIPPED, CREATED_DIR, and ERROR actions with timestamps.
- `FolderSyncWorker`: Integrated `SyncActionLog` calls at all upload, download, skip, error, and directory creation points.
- `SystemMonitorActivity`: New `getSyncActivityLog()` section displaying the 25 most recent sync actions with summary counts. Added `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` for dynamic bottom padding based on navigation bar height.
- `activity_system_monitor.xml`: Added `id` and `clipToPadding="false"` to `NestedScrollView` for proper WindowInsets handling.
- New test class `SyncActionLogTest` with 15 unit tests covering all action types, ordering, formatting, clear, and timestamp format.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Hide hidden files/folders: New "Show hidden files/folders" toggle in the sort dialog. Files and folders starting with a dot (e.g. `.config`, `.cache`) are now hidden by default, reducing clutter when browsing Linux home directories or other locations with many dotfiles.
- The setting is persisted across app restarts and applies to both normal browsing and search results.
- Translations for the new option in all 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).

### Fixed
- Sync icon was incorrectly shown on parent folders (e.g. "Podcasts") when only a deeper subfolder (e.g. "Podcasts/BundB") was configured for sync. Now only the actual sync-configured folder displays the sync icon.
- Local folder collision check for sync configurations: Prevents setting up sync on a local folder that is already synced, or is a parent/child of an already-synced folder. Supports Android Content-URIs with encoded path separators (`%2F`). Translations in all 7 languages.
- Memory leak: `FileBrowserUIState` (Dagger singleton) retained a reference to a destroyed `FileBrowserActivity` via `syncFolderDisplay` (TextView), causing a ~2 MB leak on every activity recreation (e.g. rotation).
- Navigation state lost on device rotation: Browsing a subfolder and rotating the device would reset the file browser to the root directory, because `FileBrowserState.setConnection()` cleared the current path on every activity restart.

### Developer Notes
- `PreferencesManager`: New `saveShowHiddenFiles()`/`getShowHiddenFiles()` methods with `show_hidden_files` SharedPreferences key (default: `false`).
- `FileBrowserState`: New `showHiddenFiles` field and `showHiddenFilesLiveData`, loaded from preferences on initialization.
- `FileListViewModel`: New `filterHiddenFiles()` method applied after sorting in all `loadFiles` paths (cache, server, force-refresh) and in search results. New `setShowHiddenFiles()` triggers cache invalidation and reload.
- `DialogController.showSortDialog()`: Wired `show_hidden_files_checkbox` to `FileListViewModel`.
- `dialog_sort.xml` (portrait + landscape): Added CheckBox for the new option.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Continuous folder synchronization: Automatically sync a local folder with a remote SMB folder in the background using WorkManager.
- Sync directions: Local → Remote, Remote → Local, or Bidirectional with configurable intervals (15 min to 24 hours).
- Sync setup dialog accessible from the file browser menu, with folder picker, direction, interval, and remote path configuration.
- Manage sync configurations dialog: view, enable/disable, and delete sync configs.
- "Sync Now" button for triggering immediate one-time sync.
- "Newer Wins" conflict resolution strategy for bidirectional sync.
- Automatic cleanup of sync configurations when a connection is deleted.
- Translations for all sync strings in all 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH).
- Share text from other apps: When sharing text (ACTION_SEND with EXTRA_TEXT) from apps like Notes or Chrome, SambaLite now creates a temporary `.txt` file and uploads it to the last opened SMB folder. The filename is derived from EXTRA_SUBJECT (if available) with a timestamp suffix.
- Automatic cleanup of temporary shared-text files after successful upload staging.
- Quit button: Users can now stop the background service and close the app via a power icon in the toolbar or a "Stop" action in the foreground notification.
- Confirmation dialog when quitting with active operations: Shows the number of running transfers and lets the user choose to cancel them or continue.

### Changed
- Upgraded to JDK 21 (source/target compatibility, GitHub CI workflows).
- Updated Android Gradle Plugin from 8.10.1 to 8.12.0 and Gradle from 8.12 to 8.13.
- Updated dependencies: Kotlin 2.1.0 → 2.3.10, Activity 1.9.2 → 1.12.4, Core-KTX 1.16.0 → 1.17.0, Lifecycle 2.9.4 → 2.10.0, SwipeRefreshLayout 1.1.0 → 1.2.0, Dagger 2.57.2 → 2.59.2, BouncyCastle 1.79 → 1.83, Timber 4.7.1 → 5.0.1, Robolectric 4.16 → 4.16.1, Mockito 5.20.0 → 5.22.0.
- Raised compileSdk and targetSdk from 35 to 36.
- Streamlined welcome screen text: Removed redundant "tap the + button" hint from the welcome subtitle in all 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, NL, PL, ZH). The FAB is self-explanatory.

### Fixed
- Fixed System Monitor button not working when inside a folder (FileBrowserActivity). The menu handler was missing; tapping the button had no effect outside the main screen.
- Fixed `BackgroundSmbManager.ensureServiceStartedAndBound()`: `bindService` now executes even when `startForegroundService` fails (fallback behavior).
- Fixed `BackgroundSmbManager.requestCancelAllOperations()`: Falls back to `bindService` with `ACTION_CANCEL` when `startForegroundService` fails.
- Fixed `SmartErrorHandler.setupGlobalErrorHandler()`: Resolved recursion bug where the previous `UncaughtExceptionHandler` was queried at runtime instead of being captured before replacement, causing a StackOverflow.
- Eliminated Mockito dynamic agent loading warning by attaching `byte-buddy-agent` as a `-javaagent` JVM argument.
- Resolved SLF4J "No providers found" warning by adding `slf4j-simple` test dependency.
- Suppressed Robolectric SDK 36 warning by pinning tests to SDK 34.
- Removed deprecated `Notification.priority` usage in tests; replaced with `NotificationChannel.getImportance()`.
- Suppressed unchecked cast warning in `LiveDataTestUtil`.
- Network scan dialog no longer dismisses when touching outside the dialog, preventing accidental scan resets during scanning or when viewing results.
- Add/Edit connection dialogs no longer dismiss when touching outside the dialog, preventing accidental data loss.
- Users must now explicitly use the Cancel button to dismiss dialogs, matching expected behavior.
- Quit/Stop button in the foreground notification now works correctly. Previously, the background service was automatically restarted after being stopped.
- Downloads and uploads after quit and reopen now work correctly. Previously, operations would queue indefinitely because the service binding was not properly restored.
- Foreground notification ("SMB Service Ready") is now consistently restored whenever any SMB operation is performed (download, upload, rename, delete, create folder, browse files). Previously, the notification would not reappear after being stopped until the app was fully restarted.
- Foreground notification now shows the current operation status (e.g. "Renaming: folder", "Downloading: file.txt", "Uploading: photo.jpg") during all file operations. Previously, the notification text remained static ("SMB Service Ready") while operations were running.

### Developer Notes
- New package `sync`: `SyncConfig`, `SyncDirection`, `SyncRepository` (SharedPreferences/JSON), `SyncManager` (WorkManager scheduling), `FolderSyncWorker` (recursive sync logic).
- DI: `AppModule` provides `SyncRepository` and `SyncManager`; `SyncManager` injected into `FileBrowserActivity` and `MainViewModel`.
- `MainViewModel.deleteConnection()` now calls `syncManager.removeConfigsForConnection()`.
- UI: `dialog_sync_setup.xml`, new menu entry `action_sync`, `DialogController` with `SyncSetupCallback`, `ActivityResultController` with sync folder picker.
- WorkManager: unique periodic work `sambalite_folder_sync`, `NetworkType.CONNECTED` constraint, exponential backoff.
- Tests: `SyncRepositoryTest` (16 tests), `SyncManagerTest` (14 tests).
- `ShareReceiverActivity`: Added `createTempTextFile()` for EXTRA_TEXT handling; files stored in `<cache>/shared_text/` with sanitized filenames.
- `FileOperationsController`: Added `cleanupSharedTextSourceFile()` to delete temp files after staging.
- Tests: `ShareReceiverActivityTest` (16 tests), `FileOperationsControllerCleanupTest` (4 tests).
- `robolectric.properties` created with `sdk=34` to avoid SDK 36/Java 21 mismatch warnings.
- Mockito agent is now attached statically via `doFirst` block in `unitTests.all` (Gradle).
- `SmbBackgroundService`: Added `ACTION_STOP` handling (cancels operations, stops foreground, stops self). Stop action shown in notification when idle. Added `stopRequested` flag to prevent service restart after explicit stop. `ACTION_STOP` now explicitly cancels all running futures, stops the watchdog, and calls `notificationManager.cancel()` to ensure the notification is removed.
- `BackgroundSmbManager`: Exposed `hasActiveOperations()`, `getActiveOperationCount()`, and `requestStopService()`. Added `stopRequested` flag; `onServiceDisconnected` no longer auto-restarts the service when a stop was requested. `requestStopService()` now unbinds the service before sending `ACTION_STOP`, so `stopSelf()` can take effect. Added `ensureServiceRunning()` to allow restoring the service after quit and reopen. The `stopRequested` flag is reset when the service is intentionally restarted via `ensureServiceStartedAndBound()`. On reconnect, the manager mirrors the service's `stopRequested` state. `requestStopService()` now also resets `bindingInProgress` to prevent the next `ensureServiceStartedAndBound()` from being blocked (since `unbindService()` does not trigger `onServiceDisconnected`). `ensureServiceRunning()` now handles the case where the service is still bound but was stopped via the notification: it sends a `startForegroundService` intent without re-binding, avoiding `bindingInProgress` deadlock.
- `FileListViewModel` and `FileOperationsViewModel`: Now receive `BackgroundSmbManager` via dependency injection. All SMB operations (loadFiles, downloadFile, downloadFolder, uploadFile, uploadFolderContents, createFolder, deleteFile, renameFile) call `ensureServiceRunning()` before execution, ensuring the foreground service and notification are always active during operations. All file operations in `FileOperationsViewModel` now call `startOperation()`/`finishOperation()` to update the foreground notification with the current operation status (e.g. "Renaming: folder", "Downloading: file.txt").
- `ShareReceiverViewModel`: Updated constructor to pass `BackgroundSmbManager` through to parent `FileOperationsViewModel`.
- `MainActivity`: Added `handleQuit()` with `MaterialAlertDialog` for active operations, `performQuit()` with `requestStopService()` + `finishAffinity()`. Quit icon (`ic_lock_power_off`) shown directly in toolbar. Calls `ensureServiceRunning()` in `onCreate()` to restore the foreground notification after quit and reopen.
- `menu_main.xml`: New `action_quit` menu item with `showAsAction="ifRoom"`.
- `MainActivity.java`: Added `setCanceledOnTouchOutside(false)` and `setCancelable(false)` to the network scan, add connection, and edit connection dialogs.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Improved button visibility in Scan and Connection dialogs for large font settings: buttons now use full-width vertical layout.
- Increased minimum height of Scan and Connection dialogs (400dp) for better usability on various display configurations.
- Streamlined welcome screen by removing redundant "Add Connection" button (FAB remains available).

### Fixed
- Buttons in Network Scan dialog were not visible with certain display and font settings.
- Buttons in Add/Edit Connection dialog were not visible with large font configurations.

### Developer Notes
- `dialog_network_scan.xml`: Wrapped in `NestedScrollView` with `fillViewport="true"` and `minHeight="400dp"`; button bar changed to vertical orientation with full-width buttons.
- `dialog_add_connection.xml`: Added `minHeight="400dp"` and `fillViewport="true"`; added custom vertical button bar with Save/Cancel buttons.
- `MainActivity.java`: Updated Add and Edit connection dialogs to use custom buttons instead of AlertDialog default buttons.
- `activity_main.xml`: Removed `welcome_add_button` from welcome card.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- Multi-select for files with batch Download and Delete actions.

### Changed
- Reused existing progress UI and Cancel flow; hardened dialog lifecycle (reliable open/close on success, error, or cancel).
- Unified wording and internationalization: replaced hardcoded strings in controllers/viewmodels with resources; consistent labels and summaries.
- Cleanup of temporary files/folders across success, error, and cancel paths.
- Selection UX: long-press to enter selection mode, tap toggles items, toolbar shows selected count; contextual FAB icons in multi-select mode (Download, Delete).

### Developer Notes
- Controller-driven iteration without repository API changes; improved cancel propagation and progress reporting.
- Key components: FileOperationsController, FileOperationsViewModel, ProgressController, and string resources.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added
- Per-connection security options in Add/Edit Connection: toggles to "Require encryption (SMB3)" and "Require signing".
- Translations for the new security options: de, es, fr, nl, pl, zh.

### Changed
- Use a per-connection SMB client configuration (encryption/signing) when needed instead of relying solely on a single global client.

### Fixed
- Connection failures to Samba shares with `smb encrypt = required` or signing requirements. The app now negotiates encrypted/signed sessions when configured per connection.

### Developer Notes
- SmbConnection: added boolean fields `encryptData` and `signingRequired` (persisted via ConnectionRepositoryImpl; defaults to false for existing entries).
- SmbRepositoryImpl: new `getClientFor(SmbConnection)` builds an `SmbConfig` with `withEncryptData(...)` and `withSigningRequired(...)` (fallback to `withSigningEnabled(...)` if needed) and uses it across search/list/withShare.
- UI: `dialog_add_connection.xml` adds security switches; MainActivity wires them for Add/Edit and Test Connection.

## [1.2.10] - 2025-10-06

### Added
- Chinese translation (zh).

## [1.2.9] - 2025-10-01

### Developer Notes

Code cleanup, no functional changes

## [1.2.8] - 2025-09-17

### Improvements
- Share intent: More reliable multi-file uploads. The previous absolute 60-second timeout for entire batches has been removed. Instead, a per-file inactivity watchdog (reset by progress) is used. Long uploads will no longer be aborted prematurely.
- Google Photos (Share): More robust URI handling. For URIs with the authority `com.google.android.apps.photos` we no longer call `takePersistableUriPermission()`; we rely on the temporary read grant from the intent and still perform best-effort self grants. This reduces log warnings and makes starting uploads more reliable.

### Fixed
- Premature cancellation after ~60s when the first shared file is large in the share workflow.

### Developer Notes
- `SmbBackgroundService.executeSmbOperation`: removed absolute batch timeout; only the inactivity watchdog remains.
- `FileBrowserActivity.checkAndHandleShareUpload`: skip persistable permissions for Google Photos URIs.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Share handoff to FileBrowserActivity: Share uploads are now executed in the main file browser, showing the regular consolidated transfer dialog with a working Cancel action.
- Batch upload for multiple shared files: New FileOperationsController.handleMultipleFileUploads(...) processes shared URIs sequentially inside one background operation, providing a single, smooth progress surface.
- URI permission handover: Self‑grant and persistable read permissions for shared URIs, and ClipData propagation with FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION during the handoff to ensure reliable staging.

### Changed
- ShareReceiverActivity simplified: No in‑activity uploads or progress UI. It now only parses the share intent, asks for confirmation, hands off to FileBrowserActivity, and finishes.
- Unified progress lifecycle: ProgressController lazily opens the transfer dialog only when the activity is RESUMED, and FileOperationsViewModel emits a single TransferProgress stream for both uploads and downloads.
- FileBrowserActivity notification deep‑links: Opening from upload notifications now immediately shows the regular transfer dialog and navigates to the target path.

### Fixed
- Background continuity: Share uploads are no longer canceled when the Share activity goes to background/destroys; onDestroy no longer aborts transfers.
- Window leaks prevented: Added robust lifecycle gating (RESUMED checks and re‑checks on the UI thread) to avoid android.view.WindowLeaked when activities background during dialog creation.
- Recents duplication: FileBrowserActivity launchMode set to singleTask and ShareReceiverActivity excluded from Recents; prevents multiple app cards when sharing.
- Multi‑file reliability: All shared items are now uploaded; replaced parallel fire‑and‑forget starts with sequenced batch processing guarded by latches.
- Permission Denial during staging: Mitigated by proactively granting/taking persistable URI permissions and passing ClipData across the handoff.

### Developer Notes
- BackgroundSmbManager/SmbBackgroundService continues uploads in the background; UI dialogs are restored when the app returns to foreground.
- ProgressController auto‑opens the transfer dialog upon receiving progress while the activity is RESUMED; otherwise it defers UI until safe.


## [1.2.6] - 2025-09-05

### Fixed
- **Foreground-Service Timeout (API 35/36):** Implemented `onTimeout(...)` to cleanly stop the foreground service on system timeout (releases wakelock, cancels running jobs, calls `stopForeground(STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE)` and `stopSelf()`), preventing `RemoteServiceException$ForegroundServiceDidNotStopInTimeException`.
- **Start Not Allowed (API 31+):** Guarded `startForeground(...)` with runtime-safe handling for `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` (detected by class name on API ≥ 31). The service now exits with `START_NOT_STICKY` instead of crashing when the `dataSync` budget is exhausted.

### Changed
- **Startup Robustness:** If `startForeground(...)` fails for any reason, the service no longer continues running without foreground state; it stops itself deterministically.
- **Cancellation Path:** `cancelAllOperations(...)` now reliably tears down background work and watchdogs so the service can shut down promptly when idle or on timeout.

### Developer Notes
- No change to `minSdk`. All new behaviors are gated by SDK checks (API 31+, API 35+).

## [1.2.5] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- Unified transfer pipeline (upload/download) with `isUploading`, `isDownloading`, `isAnyOperationActive`, and replayable `TransferProgress`.
- Cancel actions wired to UI (`cancelUpload()`, `cancelDownload()`).
- Search flow runs in background with cancellable progress dialog.
- Folder upload (SAF): recursive scan, structure creation, overwrite prompts, multi-file progress, cleanup.
- Edge-to-edge display via `androidx.activity` **EdgeToEdge** helper: borderless layout under system bars, backward-compatible, no deprecated flags.

### Changed
- Transfer dialog lifecycle now driven by `FileOperationsViewModel` (`isAnyOperationActive` + `getTransferProgress()`).
- Kept `fileOperationsController.setProgressCallback(progressController)` for user feedback (info/success/error & overwrite dialog), not for dialog lifecycle.
- Smoother progress: throttled updates, monotonic percentages, accurate byte-based calc, and a “finalizing” phase for local SAF copy.

### Fixed
- Prevented window leaks by closing dialogs in `onDestroy()`.
- Safe UI access checks in `ProgressController`.
- In empty folders, **Upload** and **Create Folder** FABs are shown again (explicitly visible when a directory has no items).

### Removed
- `ServiceController` (responsibilities moved into `BackgroundSmbManager`).

## [1.2.4] - 2025-08-18

The ServiceController was successfully removed in favor of direct usage of BackgroundSmbManager in FileBrowserActivity, maintaining all necessary functionality such as setting the search context and executing background operations. All changes were implemented, built, and tests verified successfully. The solution has been submitted.
The connection resolution for uploads was improved by storing and using a stable connection ID alongside the folder path, instead of relying on the connection name, which can change. This change resolved the issue of uploads failing when the connection name was changed, and the project now builds successfully without errors. The implementation was finalized and is ready for submission.
The Back functionality in the file browser was updated to navigate up one folder level instead of immediately returning to the Connections view, only leading to Connections when at the topmost folder. The implementation was validated with a successful build. No errors were encountered during the modification process.
Fix: Upload path normalization no longer duplicates the share name. A thread-local active share name is set during SMB operations and getPathWithoutShare strips it reliably (case-insensitive), preventing paths like \\server\share\share\file and fixing STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND during uploads. Built successfully.
Search caching was improved to handle server-side file changes by removing cache entries only when necessary and managing search state upon connection changes. A generation token was introduced to prevent stale updates after cancellations. All changes were verified, and there were no errors reported during testing.

### Added
- File browser: Floating action buttons now automatically hide when scrolling down and reappear when scrolling up or at the top of the list, providing more screen space while browsing files.
- Back from search results: Pressing BACK while viewing search results exits search mode and returns to the exact folder where the search was started. Works for both toolbar back and system back; also cancels any in-flight search safely.

### Changed
- Search caching: Introduced stale-while-revalidate with throttled background revalidation (per key, ≥2 min interval). Cached results show immediately; a background refresh updates the cache/UI if the server-side content changed.
- Search robustness: Added a generation token to prevent stale UI updates after cancellations or context switches; isolated searches by connection to avoid cross-connection leakage of results.
- Removed deprecated Android APIs and suppressions across the app:
  - Replaced legacy system UI flags (SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_*) with WindowCompat edge-to-edge configuration.
  - Migrated deprecated network APIs (NetworkInfo, WifiManager.getConnectionInfo) to ConnectivityManager with LinkProperties/NetworkCapabilities in NetworkScanner.
  - Updated parcelable retrieval to type-safe getParcelableExtra(key, Class) on Android 13+ with IntentCompat fallbacks for older versions.
- Modernized Gradle configuration for AGP 8.10.x:
  - Switched from deprecated lintOptions { } to lint { } DSL and consolidated disabled checks.
  - Switched from minSdkVersion to minSdk in defaultConfig.
- General deprecation cleanup: removed remaining @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") and aligned code with current Android SDK recommendations.
- Notifications: Operation notifications for Search, Upload, and Download remain tappable but no longer show a Cancel action button.

### Fixed
- Tapping an operation notification (Search/Upload/Download) now opens the correct screen and dialog, even if the file browser is already running (added proper PendingIntent and onNewIntent handling). Additionally set FileBrowserActivity launchMode to singleTop and added CLEAR_TOP | SINGLE_TOP flags to notification intents to prevent activity recreation that previously canceled running searches.
- Immediate notification refresh on operation context changes prevents stale tap targets (e.g., after a search followed by a large download, tapping now opens the Download dialog instead of the Search dialog).
- After cancelling a search and starting a download, tapping the notification no longer opens the Search dialog. The service now derives and updates the notification deep-link context at operation start (Search/Upload/Download), ensuring the tap target is always correct immediately.
- Tapping a download/upload/search notification no longer cancels the running operation: the generic fallback intent now brings FileBrowserActivity to front instead of launching MainActivity, avoiding Activity finish and unintended cancellation.
- Search robustness during transfers: If a search refresh times out because another operation (upload/download) is running, existing search results are preserved and the UI is not cleared to 0 items.
- Back from cached search results: Pressing BACK now exits search mode and returns to the starting folder even when results came from cache (previously the UI could stay on search results and required repeated presses).
- Prevented stale or post-cancel search results from overwriting the UI by guarding updates with the generation token.
- Ensured cached search results are only applied if still current; background revalidation updates them when server-side changes are detected.

> Developer note: These changes eliminate deprecation warnings on current toolchains (Java 17, AGP 8.10.1) and improve forward compatibility without altering app behavior.

## [1.2.3] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **Finalization service bridge:** Status updates during the local SAF finalization step (e.g., “Finalizing…”, “scanning files”, “copying …”, “done”) are now mirrored to the foreground service notification.
- **Multi-file progress to service:** The controller propagates per-file and byte progress to the service via `MultiFileProgressCallback` where available (single file upload staging and folder-contents upload).
- **Upload staging feedback:** During single-file uploads, the “staging/preparing” step (URI → temp file) now reports progress both in the UI and in the service notification.

### Changed
- **BackgroundSmbManager API:** Simplified `executeMultiFileOperation(String id, String name, MultiFileOperation<T> op)` (removed the `totalFiles` parameter). All controller call sites updated accordingly.
- **Controller → Notification mirroring:** The controller now forwards progress text from finalization phases to the foreground service (e.g., via `cb.updateProgress(...)` in wrapped callbacks), keeping notifications live while local copies run.
- **Callback wrapping with latches:** The controller wraps operation callbacks with a `CountDownLatch` to keep the service operation alive until the real completion callback fires (prevents premature notification completion).
- **Single-file upload staging:** Improved error and resource handling during temp-file staging; temp files are reliably cleaned up and the service is informed on failure/success.
- **Progress UX smoothing:** SMB phase is clamped to `100 - FINALIZE_WINDOW_PCT`, with the finalization phase using the remaining window for steadier overall percentages across UI and notification.
- **FileOperations throughput & accuracy:** Increased I/O buffer to 64 KB, added a pre-scan (file/byte totals) and consolidated status lines (`"Copying X/Y – name • n% (bytes)"`) for more realistic overall percentages.
- **FileOperationsController:** Moved finalization steps for downloads (both folders and single files) to asynchronous execution.
- **FileOperations:** Introduced `copyFolderAsync(...)` and enhanced `copyFileToUri(...)` with buffered streams; local SAF copies now run non-blocking and report progress.

### Fixed
- **ANR During Large Folder Copies:** Resolved an issue where synchronous copying of folders/files on the main thread could cause the app to freeze.
- **Folder Download Finalization:** The final copy step into the selected SAF destination folder now runs fully in the background, even with deeply nested directory structures.
- **Large File Download Finalization:** Copying of large single files into SAF destinations no longer blocks the user interface.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Significantly improved app responsiveness during and after long-running file operations.
- **Build & API mismatches:** Updated all controller invocations to the new `executeMultiFileOperation` signature.
- **Inner-class captures:** Resolved “local variables must be final or effectively final” issues (e.g., by capturing `finalTempFile` in wrapped callbacks).
- **Robust error propagation:** Staging errors (e.g., `copyUriToFile`) are surfaced to the service and close the operation cleanly with a failure notification.

> **Note:** Local SAF copies now have a cancellation hook in `FileOperations.Callback#isCancelled()`. Wiring a cancel token from the UI into these callbacks (to abort mid-copy) is prepared and can be completed in a follow-up release.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed
- **Folder Download Freeze at 100%**: Resolved an issue where downloading a folder could cause the app to freeze at 100% progress, leaving an empty folder.
- **Upload/Download Finalization**: Ensured proper cleanup and finalization of background file operations to prevent incomplete transfers.
- **Service Binding Reliability**: Improved lifecycle-aware binding/unbinding of the background service to avoid stale connections and missed progress updates.
- **Thread Safety & Callbacks**: Guaranteed main-thread execution for UI callbacks and improved cancellation handling for long-running operations.
- **Notification Permission Flow**: Fixed incorrect ordering of runtime permission checks and settings redirection to ensure proper display of system permission prompts and rationale before opening app settings.

### Changed
- **SmbBackgroundService**: Enhanced operation lifecycle handling with safe cancellation and reliable finalization of transfers.
- **FileOperationsController**: Decoupled from direct service dependencies, improved thread-safety, and ensured completion callbacks for all operations.
- **ServiceController**: Strengthened service connection handling with lifecycle awareness to maintain stability.
- **FileOperationsViewModel**: Improved UI update safety and executor shutdown during cleanup.
- **FileBrowserActivity**: Adjusted integration with `ServiceController` to maintain correct service binding and progress updates.
- **Permission Request Logic**: Reworked notification permission request flow to prioritize system prompts, show rationale on repeated denials, and only offer settings navigation when necessary.
